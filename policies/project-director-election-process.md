# Project Director Election Process

## Aims

* Electing new Project Directors to represent the Rust project on the board of the Rust Foundation.
* Selecting candidates that fulfill the outlined candidate criteria.
    * Selecting candidates who can be successful in the role, creating opportunities for shared power and new leadership, rather than prioritizing the best possible candidate.
    * Aiming for the overlap of tolerance rather than the overlap of preference.
* Performing the selection process as time efficiently as possible.
* Incorporating input from as many stakeholder as possible across the entire Rust project.
* Selecting from as wide a pool of qualified candidates as possible.
* Creating a psychologically safe environment where minority perspectives are valued, not ignored.
* Creating an environment that encourages positive feedback, encouragement, and tolerance, rather than preference or criticisms.
* Creating an environment that leaves participants of the process feeling positive about their interactions and how the process executed.

## Description

### Setup

* The council selects a facilitator by consent:
    * Any team member can suggest a facilitator or volunteer themselves.
    * The facilitator must not be a nominee in the election and must be someone everyone trusts to set aside their preferences during the election process.
    * **Aims of the facilitator role**
        * Clearly document, communicate/announce the process, and support it's execution
        * Track, review, and document the effectiveness of the process
* Review or Define Role Description ([example](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3392#issuecomment-1505697944))

### Pre-Meeting Coordination

* Gather nominations
    * Council representatives work with their subteams to gather nominations on behalf of their branch of the org tree
    * Subteams can use whatever process they wish but we recommend using a similar process to the macro process being used by the council
        * a set of rounds, first with each member sharing a nomination and their reasoning, followed by a change round, make a single proposal, and gather feedback/objections)
    * Each subteam should be proposing a set of project directors, one for each position being filled. 
* Share nominations publicly
    * Each team representative must share their team's nominations publicly at least 10 days before doing the final election meeting to give other teams an opporunity to share feedback or objections about candidates their team didn't initially consider with their representative.
    * This 10 day period is equivalent to the change round in the "Election Meeting" step, representatives may change their nominations in advance of the meeting

### Election Meeting

* Share nominations
    * Use a [round format](https://www.sociocracyforall.org/on-rounds/)
    * Nominations must include supporting reasoning 
* Change Round
    * In the change round, every team member will say who they nominate now and share reasons for their change if that applies.
* Facilitator proposes a candidate:
    * Based on gathered data, the facilitator suggests a candidate they believe will receive the group's consent.
* Seek objections to the facilitator's proposal
* Finalize the selection:
    * Discuss and attempt to resolve any objections, if possible.
    * Consent has been reached if the proposed choice has no remaining objections! :tada:
    * If objections persist and the current proposal reaches an impasse, the facilitator should make a new proposal based on the discussion and feedback received.
    * Continue seeking consensus and addressing objections until a satisfactory candidate is selected.
        * Note that this process seeks to produce a candidate everyone is satisfied with and has no objections to. Avoid lengthy debates over preferences not related to objections or unmet requirements.
* Document and announce the selection

## Alternatives Considered

### Voting

I've rejected voting as an option because I believe it fails to meet most of the aims listed above beyond time efficiency. Most importantly, any vote that is not unanimous fundamentally ignores some people's perspective. If someone has a strong well founded objection to a popular candidate their need will go unheard and they will likely feel alienated by the process. By relying on secret ballots instead of open nominations and justifications we loose out on a valueable opportunity to connect with each other and share positive feedback. You can object to nominees before the vote but then you're essentially at the option below I think.

### Selection and vote if multiple options are left

I'm not confident I've understood this properly, but my interpretation is that you're going to do everything up but not including "facilitator proposes a candidate" from the above process, with the possibility of including gathering objections to nominees as a form of winnowing instead of doing it based on the information shared in the nomination and change rounds. 

Assuming this interpretation is accurate, I'd push back against it on the basis that I think it fails the "avoid unnecessary objections" aim, and I think it fails to take advantage of the most enjoyable parts of the selection process which is the bevy of positive feedback and information. When we gather information and perspectives from the whole team effectively we can potentially avoid the need to object to anyone at all because it may be obvious who people are generally supportive of (Ask JP how this went with launchpad).

[^1]: During the nomination round, it is incredibly tempting to just go with the group energy, especially when you are speaking late in the round. Writing down your nomination will encourage you to share your genuine nomination without getting swayed to soon (or not at all). So often, the best ideas are the ones that seem peripheral at first.
