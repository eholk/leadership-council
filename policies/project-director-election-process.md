# Project Director Election Process

## Aims

The purpose of this policy is to outline a clear and efficient process for electing new Project Directors to represent the Rust project on the board of the Rust Foundation. The process aims to achieve the following goals:

* Select candidates who fulfill the outlined candidate criteria in the [role description document](TODO: link), focusing on shared power and new leadership rather than solely prioritizing the best candidate.
    * Strive for tolerance and inclusivity, aiming for the overlap of tolerance rather than the overlap of preference. In other words, we want to prioritize a selection that everyone can accept over selecting anyone's first choice.
* Conduct the selection process in a time-efficient manner.
* Incorporate input from a wide range of stakeholders across the entire Rust project.
* Ensure a diverse pool of qualified candidates for selection.
* Create a psychologically safe environment that values minority perspectives and encourages positive feedback, encouragement, and tolerance rather than preference or criticism.
* Ensure participants feel positive about their interactions and the execution of the process.
* Ensure the process is compliant with Rust Foundation bylaws and by extension Delaware corporation law.

## Description

### Setup

* The council selects a facilitator by consent:
    * Any team member can suggest a facilitator or volunteer themselves.
    * The facilitator must not be a nominee in the election and must be someone everyone trusts to set aside personal preferences during the election process.
    * **Aims of the facilitator role**
        * Clearly documenting and communicating the process and announcing and supporting its execution.
        * Tracking, reviewing, and documenting the effectiveness of the process.
* Review Role Description ([example](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3392#issuecomment-1505697944))

    * Qualifications
    * Term

### Pre-Meeting Coordination

* Gather nominations
    * The nomination process begins with an announcement from the facilitator chosen in the Setup phase. Council representatives should help publicize this announcement to their team as well.
    * The announcement will specify a date by which nominations must be submitted. This date will be no less than two weeks from the date the announcement goes out, and no more than four weeks.
    * Council representatives collaborate with their subteams to collect nominations on behalf of their branch of the organization tree.
    * Subteams can utilize any process they prefer, but we recommend following a similar approach to the process outlined in the "Election Meeting" section below
    * The facilitator may a minimum or maximum time period 
* Share nominations
    * Each team representative must share their team's nominations and the reasoning for their nominations with the council's selected facilitator.
    * The facilitator must publicly share all team's nominations and reasonings at least ten days before the final election meeting.
        * This allows other teams to share feedback or objections about candidates their team didn't initially consider with their representative.
    * This 10-day period is equivalent to the Change Round in the "Election Meeting" step; representatives may change their nominations in advance of the meeting, this does not require restarting the 10-day period.

### Election Meeting

* Share nominations
    * Write down nominations first[^1].
    * Use a round format (e.g. [round format](https://www.sociocracyforall.org/on-rounds/))
    * Nominations must include supporting reasoning 
* Change Round
    * During the change round, every team member will share their set of nominees and the reasons for their change if that applies.
* Facilitator proposes a candidate:
    * Based on gathered data, the facilitator suggests a candidate they believe will receive the group's consent.
* Seek objections to the facilitator's proposal
* Finalize the selection:
    * Discuss and attempt to resolve any objections, if possible.
    * Consent has been reached if the proposed choice has no remaining objections! :tada:
    * If objections persist and the current proposal reaches an impasse, the facilitator should make a new proposal based on the discussion and feedback received.
    * Continue seeking consensus and addressing objections until a satisfactory candidate is selected.
        * Note that this process seeks to produce a candidate everyone is satisfied with and has no objections to. Avoid lengthy debates over preferences not related to objections or unmet requirements.
* Document and announce the selection

[^1]: During the nomination round, it is incredibly tempting to just go with the group energy, especially when you are speaking late in the Round. Writing down your nomination will encourage you to share your genuine nomination without getting swayed too soon (or not at all). So often, the best ideas are the ones that seem peripheral at first.
