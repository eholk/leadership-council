# Raw Notes

(These are raw notes that were collected during the 2023 Project Director
Elections in order to produce the [retrospective]. They are preserved here in case
they are helpful but generally people should read the final report instead.)

To help facilitate the review, let's track notes and feedback here that we can incorporate into future election rounds. In time this should be a more formal report, but for now let's just jot down thoughts while they are fresh in our mind.

## What went well?

* (eholk) We got plenty of nominations!
* (eholk) At least one nominee mentioned they really liked hearing the positive feedback given in support of their nomination.
* (eholk) We elected new Project Directors, and basically on time!
* (eholk) We got helpful feedback during the feedback period

## What could have gone better?

* (eholk) Having phase 1 nominations close during the week of RustConf was less than ideal.
    * Also, the elections happened right before EuroRust. It turns out working on announcing the results during EuroRust wasn't a ideal.
* (eholk) The timeline felt constrained.
    * This should be less of an issue going forward though because we can reuse most of the process we have, as long as we keep an eye on the timeline so elections don't take us by surprise.
* (rylev) Having phase 1 end on a Friday is hard. We had last minute considerations that could have been resolved more easily if there was 1 more work day immediately after the deadline.
* (eholk) There was a lot to do between the time nominations closed and when we promised to publicly announce them. In particular, with asking whether nominees accepted the nomination, I basically gave everyone around 24 hours to make a decision, which seems like way too little time to make a decision like that.
    * Somewhat mitigated by the fact that most teams did their nominations in public on Zulip and @mentioned the people being nominated. Most nominees were likely not surprised and already had a good idea whether they'd accept the nomination. (In at least one case, we had someone decline during the nomination phase.)
    * Folding the "consent to nomination" step into Phase 1 might work. We could say teams should make sure their nominees consent before handing the nominations to the Council, while still saying they do not have to consent to be discussed (and it's actually encouraged not to ask them for the reasons given in process document.)
        * We probably need a more thorough and structured eligibility / CoI reporting phase in general. For example, two of our nominees just weren't eligible because they had an employment conflict with our existing PDs. It seems less than ideal to advertise a large list of nominees when not all can actually be genuinely considered.
* (eholk) names
    * One thing that would have helped was clearer communication with the Foundation early on. I think what touched this off is that the Foundation saw we posted names like lcnr, scottmcm, and Jubilee, and then were concerned that we were going to submit these names as project directors and felt the need to clarify. This led to the Foundation using the term "legal name" which is a term that is often threatening to trans people, since some people ask for legal name as a coded way of trying to determine if someone is trans and further harassing them.
    * On the Council, we actually discussed how to list the candidates' names. We decided to list them as they are best known within the Rust community, but we did not intend that this is how they would be identified to the Foundation.
    * We should made it clear that if elected candidates would need to give their name to the Foundation and that this would be listed on a public IRS 990 filing, and that the role of Project Director is one with legal responsibilities. For example, if there is legal action taken against the Foundation, the Project Directors would be served with papers.
    * Clearer communication up front (although admittedly we didn't know all these things) would have avoided these issues. By the time we discovered them, enough of the conversation had happened in public that the Foundation was limited in what options they were able to offer.
* (eholk) confusion and lack of agreement around the definition of employment

## Where we got lucky?

* (eholk) We had enough nominees to have several choices despite employment conflicts
