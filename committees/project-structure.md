# Rust Project Structure Committee

## Mission

The *Rust Project Structure* committee is tasked with:

- Determining the "shape" of the Rust Project and its membership
- Making proposals to the Council on any recommended changes
- Producing documentation clarifying the Project structure

## Goals

The goals of the committee are to address the following concerns, and to determine if there are any changes that should be proposed to the Council:

- Review the structure of the Project. <https://github.com/rust-lang/leadership-council/issues/33>
- Propose guidelines for determining whether or not to accept a new team in the project.
  In essence, more clearly answer the question of "what is the Rust Project?".
- Make recommendations on organizational cleanup.
    - Identify concerns around the current structural schemes.
    - Ensure all teams and other governance structures are "attached" to appropriate places in the structure. This includes working with teams to find appropriate homes, and ensuring such changes are ultimately reflected in the team metadata repository.
    - Re-organize the top-level teams. <https://github.com/rust-lang/leadership-council/issues/32>
    - Find homes for teams in the launching-pad, and determine the long-term role of the launching pad.
- Collect and organize team charters. <https://github.com/rust-lang/leadership-council/issues/44>
    - Every team or group should have a charter that defines certain properties about them (their purview, mission, membership, etc.).
    - This is intended to feed back into the prior points, as it can be difficult in some cases to understand what the structure should be if we don't know what the purview or responsibilities of existing teams are.
- Better define "team", "sub-team", "working-group", and "project group".
    - https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/2856-project-groups.html
    - https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-governance/blob/master/draft-rfcs/taxonomy.md
    - And possibly determine if different structures or terminology is needed.
- Propose a policy around inactive teams/groups (along with defining what "inactive" means).

## Delegated Responsibilities

No decision-making authority is given to this committee. It is only responsible for producing recommendations to the Council (and ultimately post RFCs to make changes), along with documentation of the existing structures.

## Duration

This is a temporary committee, intended to last as long as needed to accomplish the goals listed above. The committee may be retired earlier if they decide to reduce the scope of the goals.

After approximately six months, the Council should reevaluate and review the committee's progress, and if it is still working, or if it should wind down.
